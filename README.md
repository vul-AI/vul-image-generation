# Vul-Image-Generator

### What is this?
This crate handles image related stuff for VulAI which can be either image generation or manipulation be it img2img or noise2img or text2image, maybe someday Audio2Image?

### What I want
I think what I want with this crate is it to cover the different types of image creation/manipulation tasks.
- [ ] Noise-To-Image
- [ ] Text-To-Image
- [ ] Image-To-Image
- [ ] Upscaling
- [ ] Inpainting
